Codebreaker
===========

This is Codebreaker, extended from Chelimsky's The RSpec Book, version 2011-12-13.

The master branch will contain all extended features. The original branch contains Codebreaker as it was built and left in The RSpec Book. Other branches will contain new features as they are built on each other.

To play, have at least Ruby 1.8.7 installed, clone, and run 'bin/codebreaker' from the project directory.
